<h1>Code Review 02: Cheatsheet of CSS Selectors</h1>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.</p>

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!</p>

<p>Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML. Your site should utilize a custom color scheme.</p>

<p>Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I have created a cheatsheet for the basic CSS selectors I have learnt through Codecademy. Please review my code and comment me for the improvement or feedback.</p>
